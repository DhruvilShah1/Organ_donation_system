# Organ_donation_system
In the present-day scenario though there are many donors, their donations are unable to reach the needy at the right time or due to third parties, malpractices in all the cases such as blood donation and organ donation, fund donation, household items or any other donations.
The organ donation website aims to create a centralized platform facilitating organ donation processes, bridging the gap between donors and recipients in need.
The primary objective is to streamline and enhance the organ donation journey by providing a secure, user-friendly, and efficient online space for donors, recipients, doctors, and administrators.
The website focuses on a user-centric design, ensuring a seamless experience for all stakeholders. It incorporates modules for donors, recipients, doctors, and administrators, each tailored to meet their specific needs.
